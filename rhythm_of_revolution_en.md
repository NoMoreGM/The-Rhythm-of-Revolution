# The Rhythm of Revolution: A Calm Reflection and Future Reference on the Cultural Revolution

> The masses must not only rise well, but also pause well.

## I. Introduction: A Calm Reflection, Facing the Future

This is a calm and systematic historical review,  
aimed solely at deeply understanding the following questions:

- Why did the mass movement of the Cultural Revolution ultimately fall into rhythm disorder?
- Why did Mao Zedong only vaguely realize in his later years that "revolution needs rhythm"?
- Given that "history has systemic inertia while individual life is limited," how can future generations design the "rhythm of revolution"?

This paper is a rational review of the Cultural Revolution,  
and a reference left for the future.

## II. The Physiological Limits and Pressure Chains of the Mass System

The masses are the true driving force of history,  
but they are not a perpetual motion machine.  
The mass system has physiological and psychological limits.

### From the Perspective of Neuroscience

- The prefrontal cortex is the critical area for controlling rational judgment and self-regulation;
- Constant immersion in environments of loud quarrels, factional struggles, and labeling brings sustained, intense destructive pressure, damaging prefrontal cortex function and allowing the limbic system ("emotional brain") to take over decision-making;
- As a result, group behavior becomes fragmented, impulsive, and internally consumed.

### The Mass Pressure Chain in the Cultural Revolution

- Struggles, labeling, and factional conflicts constituted a "destructive pressure chain";
- The prefrontal cortex of the masses endured prolonged destructive stress, draining both mental and physical energy;
- Organizational capacity declined, rational judgment was impaired, and the movement gradually lost control.

The mass movement was perceived as something that "must advance continuously,"  
but revolutionary masses equally require physiological and psychological recovery periods.

## III. Rhythm Mismatch Between the Cadre System and the Masses

### The Cadre System: An Accidental Rest Period

- The old cadre system was "sent down for labor," temporarily removed from the frontline of mass movement;
- By leaving the chaos of struggle, they unexpectedly obtained psychological and interpersonal repair windows;
- Quietly accumulated strength, and prepared for resurgence.

### The Mass System: Continuous Overload

- The masses engaged in intense struggles continuously, without a "forced cooling period";
- Loyal revolutionary youth were caught in factional struggles, spiraling into impaired rationality;
- Lacking institutional protection and periodic recovery, the mass foundation was severely weakened.

In the end, the cadre system successfully revived during the cooling period,  
while the mass system consumed itself in overheating.

This is the core of rhythm mismatch:

> They were resting, we were burning.

## IV. Mao Zedong’s Late Realization: The Mismatch Between Historical Rhythm and Individual Lifespan

In his later years, Mao Zedong gradually realized:

- Revolution needs "civil struggle, not armed struggle";
- It requires "rectification," "summary," and a return to rationality;
- The mass movement needs periodic rest and recovery.

These statements show that he recognized the problem of rhythm:  
the mass movement needed braking and a window of recovery.

However, historical inertia was overwhelming.  
When he proposed adjustments:

- The masses were exhausted and could no longer ignite a new cycle;
- The cadre system had quietly completed self-repair and reorganization;
- The system had slipped into an automatic cycle of cognitive disorder, hard to reverse.

Personal awakening could not catch up with the historical rhythm, leading to an irreversible situation.

This is the cruelty of history:

> History has systemic inertia, but individual life is limited.

Opponents even took advantage of Mao Zedong’s late reflections, distorting them as "self-denial of the Cultural Revolution."

## V. The Rhythm Model of Revolution: Redesigning the Cycle of Mass Movements

Summarizing historical experience, we propose a complete rhythm model of revolution.

Core principles:

- **Preserve the "Four Great Freedoms": mass speaking out, mass airing of views, mass debates, and mass posting of big-character posters.**
- **During the cooling period, the masses continue to speak out, accumulate evidence, and improve their abilities — but refrain from labeling, struggle sessions, or rebellious actions.**
- **During the next activation period, the masses may use labeling, struggle sessions, and rebellion — but only based on evidence collected during the cooling period, with justified, well-grounded, and publicly verifiable actions.**

| Stage         | Role of the Masses                                       | Cadre Mechanism                                | Protective Measures |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Activation    | Masses rise up to criticize and break the silence         | Cadres relinquish power and accept mass supervision | Prevent retaliatory suppression |
| Cooling       | Collect evidence, cultivate abilities, keep the "Four Freedoms" open | Continue to be sent down, accept mass supervision | Prohibit labeling, rebellion, and factional fighting |
| Re-activation | Resume action based on evidence, use the "Four Freedoms", apply labeling, struggle sessions, and rebellion if necessary | Cadres face mass audits and public judgment | Actions must be evidence-based, justified, and publicly verifiable |
| Conclusion    | Summarize theories and pass on experiences               | Review experiences to prevent restoration | Systematize lessons for the next cycle |

Key takeaways:

- **Struggle methods are not abolished, and mass fighting spirit remains undiminished.**
- **Struggle tools are applied with precision, avoiding misuse.**
- **The cooling period becomes a phase for the masses to recover and store strength, preventing cadres from taking advantage of chaos to restore power.**

In this way, revolution avoids simply "burning to the end,"  
and instead becomes a scientific cycle of "energy storage → precise release → re-storage."

## VI. Scientific Perspective Serving Mass Movements

Concepts such as the prefrontal cortex and pressure chains are designed to aid the understanding of mass system dynamics:

- The masses are real entities with physiological and psychological limits;
- Mass movements must respect the laws of systemic pressure, maintain rhythm, and avoid self-destruction through internal exhaustion.

The masses must not only rise well, but also pause well.  
This is the lesson history has entrusted to us.

## VII. Conclusion

Revolution not only requires burning passion, but also the conscious mastery of rest periods.  
By scientifically managing the cycle of mass movements, respecting the masses as protagonists with their own physiological laws,  
we can design a rhythmic and resilient revolutionary process.

Only then can we avoid the masses burning themselves out,  
and prevent the revolution from being exploited by its enemies.
